# CONTRIBUTING

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the *source* file.

-   YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
-   NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

-   We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
-   Look at the R-CMD-check build status before and after making changes. The
    `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
    by the package.
-   We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org). You
    can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
    apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do
    with your PR.
-   We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).
-   We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat).
    Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
-   For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
    current development version header describing the changes made followed by
    your GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
