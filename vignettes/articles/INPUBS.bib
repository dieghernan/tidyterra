	abstract     = {Grasslands across the African continent are under pressure from climate change and human activities, particularly in arid ecosystems. From a remote sensing perspective, these ecosystems have not received much scientific attention, especially in Namibia. To address this knowledge gap, various remote sensing methods were implemented using new generation spaceborne imaging spectrometers amongst others. Therefore, this research provides a first methodological approach aimed at mapping and evaluating the distribution of grasslands within two private nature reserves, namely, the NamibRand Nature Reserve (NRNR) and ProNamib Nature Reserve (PNNR) with surrounding farmlands on the edge of Namib Sand Sea. The multi-sensor approach utilizes Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) and incorporated spectral information collected in the field to analyze grasslands. The research involves a sensor comparison of multispectral Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data, hyperspectral data from Environmental Mapping and Analysis Programme (EnMAP) and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) and an additional data fusion product derived from Sentinel-2 and EnMAP imagery based on a Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation Hypersharpening method (SFIM-HS). Additionally, a unique spectral library of collected field spectra was established and inter-species spectral separability and intra-species spectral homogeneity was analyzed. This library presents newly published spectra of individual species. Due to dry initial conditions, the calculated spectral separability of individual grasses is limited, making only a mean endmember feasible for partial unmixing. The validation results of satellite comparison show that data fusion products (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51 with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66 with Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)) are more suitable for mapping arid grasslands than multispectral or hyperspectral data (all R<sup>2</sup> < 0.35). More research is required and potential methodological adjustments are discussed to further investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of arid grasslands and to aid conservation efforts in the Greater Sossusvlei-Namib Landscape in line with the United Nations Decade of Restoration.}

	abstract     = {Maps showing the thickness of sediments above the bedrock (depth to bedrock, or DTB) are important for many geoscience studies and are necessary for many hydrogeological, engineering, mining, and forestry applications. However, it can be difficult to accurately estimate DTB in areas with varied topography, like lowland and mountainous terrain, because traditional methods of predicting bedrock elevation often underestimate or overestimate the elevation in rugged or incised terrain. Here, we describe a machine learning spatial prediction approach that uses information from traditional digital elevation model derived estimates of terrain morphometry and satellite imagery, augmented with spatial feature engineering techniques to predict DTB across Alberta, Canada. First, compiled measurements of DTB from borehole lithologs were used to train a natural language model to predict bedrock depth across all available lithologs, significantly increasing the dataset size. The combined data were then used for DTB modelling employing several algorithms (XGBoost, Random forests, and Cubist) and spatial feature engineering techniques, using a combination of geographic coordinates, proximity measures, neighbouring points, and spatially lagged DTB estimates. Finally, the results were contrasted with DTB predictions based on modelled relationships with the auxiliary variables, as well as conventional spatial interpolations using inverse-distance weighting and ordinary kriging methods. The results show that the use of spatially lagged variables to incorporate information from the spatial structure of the training data significantly improves predictive performance compared to using auxiliary predictors and/or geographic coordinates alone. Furthermore, unlike some of the other tested methods such as using neighbouring point locations directly as features, spatially lagged variables did not generate spurious spatial artifacts in the predicted raster maps. The proposed method is demonstrated to produce reliable results in several distinct physiographic sub-regions with contrasting terrain types, as well as at the provincial scale, indicating its broad suitability for DTB mapping in general.}

	abstract     = {Downy mildew is a severe disease that leads to significant losses in grape yields worldwide. It is caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. The study of the distribution of this agent and the search for endophytic organisms that inhibit the growth of P. viticola are essential objectives to facilitate the transition to sustainable and high-yield agriculture, while respecting the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the ITS (ITS1f/ITS2 region) and 16S (V4 region) amplicons was employed to analyze 80 samples of leaves and stems from different grapevine species and cultivars grown in the Russian Far East (Vitis amurensis Rupr., Vitis coignetiae Pulliat, and several grapevine cultivars). The analysis revealed the presence of P. viticola in 53.75% of the grape samples. The pathogen P. viticola was not detected in V. amurensis samples collected near Vladivostok and Russky Island. Among the P. viticola-affected samples, only two (out of the eighty analyzed grape samples) from the Makarevich vineyard in Primorsky Krai exhibited disease symptoms, while the majority appeared visually healthy. We also found six distinct P. viticola ASVs in our metagenomic data. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that the P. viticola population in the Russian Far East may have originated from the invasive P. viticola clade aestivalis, which has spread around the world from North America. To identify putative microbial antagonists of P. viticola, a differential analysis of high-throughput sequencing data was conducted using the DESeq2 method to compare healthy and P. viticola-affected samples. The in silico analysis revealed an increased representation of certain taxa in healthy samples compared to P. viticola-affected ones: fungi—Kabatina sp., Aureobasidium sp., and Vishniacozyma sp.; bacteria—Hymenobacter spp., Sphingomonas spp., Massilia spp., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum spp., and Chryseobacterium spp. This in-silico-obtained information on the potential microbial antagonists of P. viticola serves as a theoretical basis for the development of biocontrol agents for grapevine downy mildew.}

The “Cerambyx complex” (CC) constitutes an emerging pest in Mediterranean oak woodlands. We studied the fragmentation and connectivity of holm and cork oak stands in Andalusia (Spain), and the relationships with the current dispersion of CC, as well as the effect on the connectivity and dispersion patterns with the implementation of nests of a predator bird (Garrulus glandarius) to reduce insect populations in highly connected areas. The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was used to assess the spatial distribution of CC. Connectivity was assessed using graphs theory (Graphab 2.6) to characterize the importance of patches and linkages for contributing to dispersal. We selected the Eurasian jay (G. glandarius) as a reference bird species to generate “barriers” to the dispersion of the CC. We used the probability of connectivity (PC) and the flux (F) to compare the effect of the introduction of Eurasian jay nets. Results showed an increasing trend in the distribution and incidence of CC during the period 2001–2016, resulting in 7.3% and 13.1% mortality rates for Q. ilex and Q. suber, respectively. The connectivity model using only Q. ilex and Q. suber forests as reference habitats was not enough to explain the distribution of CC. The value of PC and F metrics decreased by 38.09% and 20.59% by introducing 300 nests of Eurasian jay. Our methodology provides a pest management tool using connectivity metrics, which can be integrated with other variables to control pest outbreaks and pest dispersion.}

We here assess the combined use of very high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery and classical, open source, supervised classification approaches to map artificial lawns in a typical British city. Both object-based and pixel-based classifications struggled to reliably detect artificial turf, with large patches of artificial turf not being any more reliably identified than small patches of artificial turf. As urban ecosystems are increasingly recognised for their key contributions to human wellbeing and health, the poor performance of these standard methods highlights the urgency of developing and applying new, easily accessible approaches for the monitoring of these important ecosystems.}

Little is known about if and how much these concerns could be alleviated by harvesting more from the oceans. We modelled the biophysical production potential of seaweeds, and their current and possible future contribution to world food supply. We estimate seaweeds currently provide up to 0.13% of global food energy supply. Seaweed production is increasing more rapidly than terrestrial production. At current rates of increase we estimate seaweed energy contribution of 0.25% in 2050. Production potential of seaweeds could contribute up to 2 to 14% of global food supply if farming 1% of the modelled suitable space within the Exclusive Economic Zone. We show this large potential contribution to world food supply will only be achieved with unprecedented increases in seaweed production, while offshore seaweed cultivation is still in its infancy. The study shows large uncertainties that warrant further research. Modelling shows vast areas of world oceans are unsuitable because of being too far out of shore, having too low nutrient concentrations or having too high waves. Only 2–9% of world oceans and 6–25% of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) was shown to be suitable for seaweed production. Identifying suitable sites for offshore seaweed cultivation is therefore important. Site suitability maps reported for the 3 model species can be useful for private companies and policy makers expanding seaweed in new high potential production areas around the world.}

	abstract     = {Understanding the vertical migration behaviour of Antarctic krill is important for understanding spatial distribution, ecophysiology, trophic interactions and carbon fluxes of this Southern Ocean key species. In this study, we analysed an eight-month continuous dataset recorded with an ES80 echosounder on board a commercial krill fishing vessel in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Our analysis supports the existing hypothesis that krill swarms migrate into deeper waters during winter but also reveals a high degree of variability in vertical migration behaviour within seasons, even at small spatial scales. During summer, we found that behaviour associated with prolonged surface presence primarily occurred at low surface chlorophyll a concentrations whereas multiple ascent–descent cycles per day occurred when surface chlorophyll a concentrations were elevated. The high plasticity, with some krill swarms behaving differently in the same location at the same time, suggests that krill behaviour is not a purely environmentally driven process. Differences in life stage, physiology and type of predator are likely other important drivers. Finally, our study demonstrates new ways of using data from krill fishing vessels, and with the routine collection of additional information in potential future projects, they have great potential to significantly advance our understanding of krill ecology.}

	abstract     = {Abstract Europe faces regular introductions and reintroductions of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes, most recently exemplified by the incursion of serotype 3 in the Netherlands. Although the long-distance wind dispersal of the disease vector, Culicoides spp., is recognized as a virus introduction pathway, it remains understudied in risk assessments. A Quantitative Risk Assessment framework was developed to estimate the risk of BTV-3 incursion into mainland Europe from Sardinia, where the virus has been present since 2018. We used an atmospheric transport model (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) to infer the probability of airborne dispersion of the insect vector. Epidemiological disease parameters quantified the virus prevalence in vector population in Sardinia and its potential first transmission after introduction in a new area. When assuming a 24h maximal flight duration, the risk of BTV introduction from Sardinia is limited to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly affecting the southwestern area of the Italian Peninsula, Sicily, Malta, and Corsica. The risk extends to the northern and central parts of Italy, Balearic archipelago, and mainland France and Spain, mostly when maximal flight duration is longer than 24h. Additional knowledge on vector flight conditions and Obsoletus complex-specific parameters could improve the robustness of the model. Providing both spatial and temporal insights into BTV introduction risks, our framework is a key tool to guide global surveillance and preparedness against epizootics.}

Hence, in forestry there is growing interest in intervention strategies such as assisted migration to mitigate climate change impacts. However, until now the primary focus when evaluating candidates for assisted migration has been mean or maximum performance. We explore phenotypic plasticity as a potentially new avenue to help maintain the viability of species and populations in the face of climate change. Capitalizing on large, multi-site international provenance trials of four economically and ecologically important forest tree species (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>, <italic>Picea abies</italic>, <italic>Picea engelmannii</italic>, <italic>Pinus contorta</italic>), we quantify growth stability as the width of the response function relating provenance growth performance and trial site climate. We found significant differences in growth stability among species, with <italic>P. engelmannii</italic> being considerably more stable than the other three species. Additionally, we found no relationship between growth performance and growth stability of provenances, indicating that there are fast-growing provenances with a broad climate optimum. In two of the four species, provenances’ growth stability showed a significant relationship with the climate of the seed source, the direction of which depends on the species. When taken together with data on growth performance in different climate conditions, a measure of growth stability can improve the choice of species and provenances to minimize future risks in forest restoration and reforestation.</p>}

Current N2O emission estimation methods at the national scale are predominantly via emission factors. Models estimating national-scale emissions are focused on growing season emissions. However, a substantial fraction of N2O can be emitted during non-growing season periods. Using newly published off-season N2O emission ratio maps and high-resolution nitrogen application data, this study explores the potential magnitude of underestimated N2O emissions if using only the default growing-season focused methodology. Although there is large variation at county scales (12\%–35\%), non-growing season national emissions are estimated at 31\% of the total, a potential 12,000 Gg CO2e year−1. Further work should better refine emission estimates spatially as well as fully integrate estimates across growing and non-growing seasons.}
