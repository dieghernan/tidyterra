		Environments are changing at an accelerated rate, as a consequence of hu- man
		activity. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the drivers of this
		change in the landscape, the mechanisms by which species are affected, and
		patterns of consequential species vulnerabilities. Here I use remote sensing
		and machine learning to investigate pathways of savannah degradation; use
		Bayesian species distribution models with data integration to test predictors
		of range shifts in savannah birds; and evaluate a common climate change vul-
		nerability assessment framework based on simulated data and foundational
		concepts. I find that the most degraded savannah sites are those that de-
		cline in resistance over time and tend to exhibit lower rainfall and higher
		human and livestock density. However, I show that the same sites do not lose
		their recovery potential, giving hope for their eventual restoration under
		correct management. I find that degradation has increased across the whole
		landscape, and that this increase was lowest for national parks and wildlife
		management areas, underlining the effectiveness of these management strate-
		gies for mitigating current degradation trends. Next, I find little support
		for broad trait-range shift relationships across taxa, for either local
		extinctions, local colonisations, or total change. This calls into question
		the usefulness of traits in vulnerability assessments of taxa, where they are
		applied to wider taxonomic groups. However, I also identify strong
		species-specific relation- ships among the results, suggesting that more
		research into those individual species might reveal important trait
		relationships. Finally, I show that vulner- ability frameworks based on
		separately assessed species sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity,
		such as many trait-based approaches, are fundamen- tally unable to accurately
		predict true vulnerability of species. I showcase how recent advances in
		species distribution modelling can be applied to develop revised
		vulnerability metrics.

		Background Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are mosquito-borne nematodes
		with dogs as primary hosts, but other mammalian species including humans can
		be also infected. In the last century, circulation of both pathogens was
		predominantly restricted to Southern Europe. However, different studies
		indicated a potential establishment in Central, Eastern and Western parts of
		Europe as an increasing threat to animal and human health.Methods We
		conducted a systematic literature review of publications reporting D. immitis
		and D. repens screening in mosquitoes and mammalian vertebrates in Europe.
		These data were used to analyse the range of vectors and hosts and for a
		comparison of the spatial distribution between the 20th and 21st
		century.Results Both nematodes appear to have a high overlap of Aedes,
		Anopheles and Culex vector species, which are abundant in Europe. Most D.
		immitis infections were reported in dogs, while D. repens predominated in
		humans. Dirofilaria immitis infections were detected in a wider range of wild
		and zoo animals. Compared to the last century, many more countries especially
		in Central Europe were affected by Dirofilaria spp. circulation, illustrating
		a significant spread over the last 20 years.Conclusion Our findings suggest
		that D. immitis and D. repens are a growing health concern for animals and
		humans in Europe. Continuous globalisation and climate warming will probably
		lead to a further spread and increased circulation in the future. All data
		are made available open access, which will enable further analysis in the
		future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing

		In recent decades, the Pyrenees have experienced an increase in
		archaeological research that has made it possible to identify new sites with
		Neolithic chronology in different parts of the mountain range, in some cases
		with signs of agricultural practices. These new archaeological data have
		begun to fill gaps in knowledge in a context in which, until the end of the
		20th century, the Balma Margineda was practically the only known Neolithic
		site in the Pyrenees, and in the knowledge of the first agricultural and
		livestock farming communities that inhabited the mountain range. These new
		studies allow us to question and propose new alternative scenarios to the
		historical and traditional views that have considered mountain environments
		such as the Pyrenees as marginal areas and only frequented by seasonal
		livestock farming groups during the summer. Based on this issue, this
		doctoral thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge of the introduction of
		agricultural and livestock practices of these first human groups, from a
		geographical perspective of the territory. In other words, it aims to
		spatially contextualize the settlements and analyses how the different land
		occupation patterns were configured throughout the Neolithic period (5700 -
		2100 cal BCE), applying different methods and techniques of Geographic
		Information Systems. Two aspects have been taken into account to define the
		land occupation patterns. On the one hand, several orographic and
		palaeoclimatic variables have been processed and analyzed in order to
		identify the geographical parameters and contexts in which the Neolithic
		settlements are located. On the other hand, the agricultural potential of the
		Pyrenees has been spatially modelled, taking into account the requirements of
		different crops and agricultural systems to test the viability of agriculture
		during the different phases of the Neolithic in the different areas of the
		Pyrenees. These methodological developments have made it possible to identify
		two settlement location patterns. The first is associated with the first
		Neolithic occupations with a mixed and diversified economy, with settlements
		linked to areas accessible to land with agricultural potential. On the other
		hand, the second pattern is related to the Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic
		occupations, linked to a livestock use of the subalpine belts.

		Abstract

		Passive approaches to nature recovery have been hailed as a low‐cost approach
		to boosting biodiversity in ecologically degraded sites. But there remains
		little evidence of whether this generalises to all climatic and ecological
		contexts.

		To address this knowledge gap, we used satellite remote sensing to examine
		vegetation change in Alladale Wilderness Reserve, a remote rewilding site in
		Scotland where active and passive approaches have simultaneously taken place
		for the past decades.

		In contrast to enclosures and tree planting, more passive approaches did not
		help regenerate the native Caledonian forest, failing to lead to structural
		or functional change within Alladale, relative to the wider landscape.
		Observed changes under both approaches were moreover much less dramatic than
		those reported for the Knepp Estate, another established rewilding site in
		Southern England.

		Our results suggest that passive rewilding is unlikely to promote significant
		biodiversity change in areas where recent human forcing of ecological
		processes has been limited, even if past human pressures have intensively
		reshaped the ecosystem—as seen in Alladale. In such situations, active
		interventions are likely to be required to shift the system onto a new
		ecological trajectory.

		Altogether, our study illustrates how freely available satellite data can (1)
		help contrast the impacts of environmental management approaches on ecosystem
		structure and functioning, in ways that complement existing ground‐based
		studies; and (2) help distinguish areas likely to benefit from passive nature
		recovery approaches from those where specific active interventions are
		needed.

		ABSTRACT

		This article aims to delineate the wildland–urban interface in the sparsely
		populated, limited‐resourced Scandinavian peninsula (excluding Finland).
		Common WUI mapping assumptions and how different thresholds capture the
		reality of building ignition from wildfire in this region are evaluated. We
		show that dedicated fuel maps capture areas at risk slightly better than
		vegetation maps, although the choice of map per se is less important than the
		selected limit for possible ember transport. The commonly used 6.17
		buildings/km 2 threshold for building density fails to capture most wildfire
		incidents that have led to building ignition.

		Climate change is expected to outpace the rate at which populations of forest
		trees can migrate. Hence, in forestry there is growing interest in
		intervention strategies such as assisted migration to mitigate climate change
		impacts. However, until now the primary focus when evaluating candidates for
		assisted migration has been mean or maximum performance. We explore
		phenotypic plasticity as a potentially new avenue to help maintain the
		viability of species and populations in the face of climate change.
		Capitalizing on large, multi-site international provenance trials of four
		economically and ecologically important forest tree species ( Fagus sylvatica
		, Picea abies , Picea engelmannii , Pinus contorta ), we quantify growth
		stability as the width of the response function relating provenance growth
		performance and trial site climate. We found significant differences in
		growth stability among species, with P. engelmannii being considerably more
		stable than the other three species. Additionally, we found no relationship
		between growth performance and growth stability of provenances, indicating
		that there are fast-growing provenances with a broad climate optimum. In two
		of the four species, provenances’ growth stability showed a significant
		relationship with the climate of the seed source, the direction of which
		depends on the species. When taken together with data on growth performance
		in different climate conditions, a measure of growth stability can improve
		the choice of species and provenances to minimize future risks in forest
		restoration and reforestation.

		Downy mildew is a severe disease that leads to significant losses in grape
		yields worldwide. It is caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. The study
		of the distribution of this agent and the search for endophytic organisms
		that inhibit the growth of P. viticola are essential objectives to facilitate
		the transition to sustainable and high-yield agriculture, while respecting
		the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the ITS
		(ITS1f/ITS2 region) and 16S (V4 region) amplicons was employed to analyze 80
		samples of leaves and stems from different grapevine species and cultivars
		grown in the Russian Far East (Vitis amurensis Rupr., Vitis coignetiae
		Pulliat, and several grapevine cultivars). The analysis revealed the presence
		of P. viticola in 53.75\% of the grape samples. The pathogen P. viticola was
		not detected in V. amurensis samples collected near Vladivostok and Russky
		Island. Among the P. viticola-affected samples, only two (out of the eighty
		analyzed grape samples) from the Makarevich vineyard in Primorsky Krai
		exhibited disease symptoms, while the majority appeared visually healthy. We
		also found six distinct P. viticola ASVs in our metagenomic data. Based on
		phylogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that the P. viticola population in the
		Russian Far East may have originated from the invasive P. viticola clade
		aestivalis, which has spread around the world from North America. To identify
		putative microbial antagonists of P. viticola, a differential analysis of
		high-throughput sequencing data was conducted using the DESeq2 method to
		compare healthy and P. viticola-affected samples. The in silico analysis
		revealed an increased representation of certain taxa in healthy samples
		compared to P. viticola-affected ones: fungi—Kabatina sp., Aureobasidium sp.,
		and Vishniacozyma sp.; bacteria—Hymenobacter spp., Sphingomonas spp.,
		Massilia spp., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum spp., and Chryseobacterium spp.
		This in-silico-obtained information on the potential microbial antagonists of
		P. viticola serves as a theoretical basis for the development of biocontrol
		agents for grapevine downy mildew.

		Abstract

		Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a significant greenhouse gas and the most important
		currently emitted ozone depleting substance, primarily via agricultural
		fertilization. Current N 2 O emission estimation methods at the national
		scale are predominantly via emission factors. Models estimating
		national‐scale emissions are focused on growing season emissions. However, a
		substantial fraction of N 2 O can be emitted during non‐growing season
		periods. Using newly published off‐season N 2 O emission ratio maps and
		high‐resolution nitrogen application data, this study explores the potential
		magnitude of underestimated N 2 O emissions if using only the default
		growing‐season focused methodology. Although there is large variation at
		county scales (12\%–35\%), non‐growing season national emissions are
		estimated at 31\% of the total, a potential 12,000 Gg CO 2 e year −1 .
		Further work should better refine emission estimates spatially as well as
		fully integrate estimates across growing and non‐growing seasons.

		, Core Ideas

		Offseason direct N 2 O emissions are significant but under‐quantified, and
		vary across space.

		Inclusion of offseason N 2 O raises net maize emissions 31\% on average in
		the United States.

		Estimated undercounting of offseason maize N 2 O emissions is approximately
		12,000 Gg CO 2 e year −1 .

		There are significant policy implications with annual N2O, given the
		importance of maize to food, fuel, and fiber.

		, Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important
		greenhouse gas. Most comes from agriculture, and so understanding how much
		nitrous oxide is being produced is important to managing climate change.
		However, most of the time we only measure the gas during the growing season.
		But other times, like winter, produce N2O also. If we don't include
		non‐growing season times in our count, we could be underestimating N2O by
		around 31\%. This has real implications for sustainable agriculture and
		biofuels, because if we are missing a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions we
		may make the wrong decisions about policy and management.

		Invasive species represent a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem
		conservation, with their impacts often amplified in island ecosystems.
		Species distribution models (SDMs) can infer the potential habitat throughout
		the life of an organism and are considered a valuable tool for predicting the

		ensemble of four presence–absence models (GLM, GAM, Random Forest, and BART)
		calibrated only with data collected in Tenerife, the island with the best
		representation of the species, to infer the habitat suitability for Pluchea
		ovalis (Pers.) DC. (Asteraceae). Subsequently, we transferred the ensembled

		under near-present conditions, the suitable areas are in the coastal and
		mid-elevations of the south slope sectors of Tenerife and Gran Canarian
		Islands, as well as a vast portion of the westernmost and drier islands,
		always coinciding with ravines and highly disturbed ecosystems. In addition,
		we forecasted the potential distribution of Pluchea ovalis under different
		climate change conditions (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585), showing how its

		ABSTRACT Soil organic matter (SOM) was the primary component of the global
		terrestrial carbon sink. Soil enzymes were important drivers of soil
		metabolism facilitating the materials cycling and the energy flow in soils.
		However, the relationship between soil enzymes and SOM composition in various
		land use types had not been clearly understood. In the current study,
		pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py‐GC/MS) was used to analyze
		the SOM composition of three land use types (grassland, forest, and cropland)
		and the relationship between soil enzyme activity and SOM composition in the
		upper watershed of Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. The activity of C‐cycling
		enzymes glucosidase, cellobiose glycosidase, xylosidase, P‐cycling enzyme
		alkaline phosphatase, and N‐cycling enzyme leucine aminopeptidase in
		grassland was the highest but the activity of S‐cycling enzyme
		methylumbelliferryl sulfate potassium salt was lowest in grassland. The
		activity of N‐cycling enzyme leucine aminopeptidase was the highest in
		forest. Aliphatic (23.1\%–25.1\%), N‐compounds (16.69\%–21.17\%), and
		aromatic (11.76\%–12.61\%) were the most abundant SOM components in the three
		land use types and the complexity of SOM molecular network in forest was the
		highest. Additionally, all the C‐cycling enzymes and N‐cycling enzyme
		acetylglucosaminidase were significantly positively related to the proportion

		Myotis yumanensis is a small insectivorous bat distributed in Western North
		America and is susceptible to white-nose syndrome, a devastating fungal
		disease. Effective management of the disease in M. yumanensis requires an
		understanding of its population structure to identify possible routes and
		barriers of disease transmission. Here we used nine microsatellite loci to
		investigate genetic variation among 336 M. yumanensis from 10 locations in
		Western Canada. Our analyses revealed high genetic diversity and low but
		statistically significant genetic differentiation among several geographic
		populations. Interestingly, though geographically it was not the most
		distant, the Lillooet population showed the highest genetic differentiation
		from others, suggesting factors other than geographic distance also
		contributed to gene flow in this species. While white-nose syndrome has been
		reported in M. yumanensis populations in neighbouring Washington State in the
		United States of America, as of 2023, the causative pathogen was not detected
		on the wings of our analyzed 336 M. yumanensis bats in Western Canada.
		However, continuing monitoring is required to provide the most updated
		information about the white-nose syndrome status in these populations. The
		knowledge of M. yumanensis population structure in Western Canada will help
		develop effective management strategies for protecting this bat species from
		white-nose syndrome.

		Abstract Climate change will alter the geographical locations most suited for

		the Caribbean. We derived optimal climatic, edaphic and socio-economic
		conditions from the distribution of intensive banana production across Latin
		America and the Caribbean, identified using remote sensing imagery. We found
		that intensive banana production is constrained to low-lying, warm aseasonal
		regions with slightly acidic soils, but is less constrained by precipitation,
		as irrigation facilitates production in drier regions. Production is limited
		to areas close to shipping ports and with high human population density.
		Rising temperatures, coupled with requirements for labour and export

		export banana production, along with yield declines in most current banana

		Abstract Background The incidence of human infections caused by
		arthropod-borne viruses, such as the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has increased
		globally due to a number of factors, such as climate change and
		globalization. The exotic mosquito species Aedes albopictus is a significant
		vector for CHIKV, raising concerns about its transmission potential in
		temperate regions, including Central Europe. We have therefore investigated
		the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for CHIKV at constant and fluctuating
		temperatures between 15 °C and 24 °C to assess the transmission risk in
		Europe. Methods Aedes albopictus mosquitoes were reared and artificially
		infected with CHIKV. Infection rates and transmission efficiencies (TEs) were
		determined after 14 days of incubation at constant and fluctuating (± 5 °C)
		mean temperatures of 15 °C, 18 °C, 21 °C and 24 °C. In addition, mosquito
		locomotor activity was measured under the same fluctuating temperature
		conditions. A risk map for CHIKV transmission in Europe was generated
		combining temperature data and the current distribution of Ae. albopictus .
		Results CHIKV transmission was observed at all tested temperatures. The
		highest TEs were recorded at fluctuating temperatures of 18 °C (54.3\%) and
		21 °C (58.6\%), while the lowest TE was observed at a constant temperature of
		15 °C (5.6\%). TEs at fluctuating temperatures of 15 °C and 24 °C were the
		same (32.5\%). Mosquito activity showed a nocturnal unimodal activity pattern
		with a peak during the start of the scotophase (hour 20). The proportion of
		active mosquitoes per hour increased with temperature and was nearly zero at
		15 °C. The risk map indicated that regions in Southern and Central Europe,
		including recently invaded areas north of the Alps, have temperatures
		theoretically allowing CHIKV transmission for at least some days per year.
		Conclusions While CHIKV can be transmitted by Ae. albopictus at 15 °C, the
		activity of this mosquito is strongly decreased at this temperature, likely
		reducing the transmission risk. These findings emphasize the importance of
		considering both vector competence and mosquito activity when assessing the
		risk of arbovirus transmission in temperate regions. Further studies are
		needed to validate these laboratory findings under field conditions.

		Species distribution models (SDMs) are used for understanding where species
		live or could potentially live and are a key resource for ecological research
		and conservation decision-making. However, current SDM methods often perform
		poorly for rare or inadequately sampled species, which includes most species
		on earth as well as most of those of the greatest conservation concern.Here,
		we evaluate the performance of three recently developed modeling approaches
		specifically designed for data-deficient situations: 1) plug-and-play
		modeling, 2) density-ratio modeling, and 3) environmental-range modeling. We
		compare the performance of these methods with Maxent, a widely used method.
		We compare model performance across sample sizes as well as comparisons
		limited to only data-poor species. We also ask to what extent model
		cross-validation performance on training data was correlated with model
		performance on independent, presence-absence data.We show that, across all
		species, one or more of the plug-and-play, density-ratio, or
		environmental-range algorithms outperformed Maxent in 72\% of cases, with
		three of the algorithms having AUC distributions not significantly different
		from Maxent{\textquoteright}s. For data-poor species (those with 20 or fewer
		occurrences), 24 of the algorithms considered had AUC distributions that were
		not significantly different from Maxent. However, despite these comparable
		AUC scores, we found that the algorithm outputs (when thresholded to predict
		presence vs absence) spanned a wide gradient of sensitivity vs. specificity.
		Specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on training data were strongly
		correlated with specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on independent
		presence-absence data, however AUC and sensitivity had weak correlations. We
		found that only for 16\% of species was the model that performed best on the
		training data the best performing model when evaluated on independent,
		presence-absence data. Finally, we show how ensembles of models that span the
		sensitivity-specificity gradient can represent model disagreement in poorly
		sampled species and improve model predictions.This work supports
		plug-and-play, density-ratio, and environmental-range modeling as useful
		alternatives to Maxent, particularly for data-deficient species. While our
		work suggests that identifying the best model for a given species is
		challenging, we argue that incorporating the predictions of multiple models
		provides a useful way forward.Data/Code for peer review Anonymized data and

		Abstract

		Premise

		Many angiosperms have evolved specialized systems that promote pollination by
		specific taxa. Therefore, plant distributions may be limited by the local
		abundance of their specialist pollinators. In eastern North America, Lobelia
		cardinalis is thought to be pollinated solely by Archilochus colubris , the
		only hummingbird species found in the region. Here we tested the hypothesis
		that the distribution of a plant species with specialized pollination is
		controlled by the range and abundance of its specialist pollinator.

		Methods

		We investigated the importance of A. colubris abundance, sourced from eBird,
		as a variable in a MaxEnt species distribution model of L. cardinalis using
		presence data from iNaturalist. We also compared hummingbird abundance
		between locations of L. cardinalis and congeneric during their respective
		flowering periods and explored whether the flowering periods of L. cardinalis
		and congenerics align with the week of peak local hummingbird abundance.

		Results

		Unexpectedly, MaxEnt modelling did not suggest that A. colubris abundance is
		a key driver of the species distribution. Lobelia cardinalis habitat
		suitability was lowest in the absence of A. colubris and increased with
		increasing abundance, but habitat suitability was also low in regions where
		hummingbird abundance is highest. Still, hummingbird abundance at L.
		cardinalis locations was generally higher than most congenerics, and L.
		cardinalis tended to flower near the week of local peak A. colubris
		abundance.

		Conclusions While populations of hummingbird‐pollinated plant species may
		require the local presence of hummingbirds, fine‐scale variation in
		hummingbird abundance may not strongly influence their spatial distributions.

		ABSTRACT The aim of the study was to assess amphibian sampling completeness
		and the overlap of sampling completeness categories with natural protected
		areas (NPAs) and key biodiversity areas (KBAs) at global scale. We evaluated
		amphibian sampling completeness across six of the earth's eight biogeographic
		realms to identify well-sampled, under-sampled, and data-gap areas in the
		context of global amphibian distribution. Additionally, we examined the
		spatial overlap of each sampling category with NPAs and KBAs. The Nearctic
		and Australasian realms had the highest number of records and well-sampled
		areas. Significant data gaps were identified, particularly in the
		Afrotropical, Indo-Malayan, Neotropical, and Palearctic realms. We found low
		levels of spatial match (< 35\%) between classified areas and NPAs/KBAs.
		Amphibian distribution data are largely incomplete, with the most extensive
		gaps in the most species-rich realms: Neotropic, Indo-Malayan, and
		Afrotropical. The low overlap between under-sampled and data-gap areas with
		NPAs and KBAs suggests that these regions, critical for amphibian diversity,
		are insufficiently represented within established conservation priorities.
		Given the urgent threats to biodiversity from global change, rapid responses
		are essential to enhance our understanding of species distributions and
		community structures in amphibians. This study provides spatial insights to
		help identify key data-gap areas for amphibian research and conservation
		prioritization.

		Identifying live tree presence following wildfire is important for burn
		damage assessments and decision making, as these trees serve as seed sources
		for recovery. Satellite-based remote sensing offers an efficient means to
		assess burn severity with products representing vegetation greenness and
		char/ash presence and their change from pre- to post-fire imagery. While
		effective at assessing burn severity (e.g. ecosystem change), there remain
		limitations in identifying fire refugia (surviving trees), due to the
		difficulty of teasing apart different green vegetation types (e.g. trees,
		shrubs, grasses). In this paper, we use 10 m Sentinel-2 satellite data to
		predict live tree presence across three sites impacted by the 2021 California
		fire season. We used vegetation indices (VIs) from post-fire imagery
		(normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], normalized burn ratio [NBR],
		normalized difference water index [NDWI], visible atmospherically resistant
		index [VARI], and burn area index [BAI]), differential VIs from pre- and
		post-fire imagery (dNDVI, dNBR, RdNBR, dNDWI, dVARI), and direct reflectance
		bands (all bands model; visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared;
		B1–B12) to predict live tree presence via random forest modeling. To
		calibrate and validate the random forest models, we photointerpreted ∼2300
		pixels per fire region using 2022 National Agriculture Imagery Program
		imagery. We performed additional field-based validation using tree
		presence/absence data two years post-fire (n = 296 observations across two
		sites). At the site level, the all bands model outperformed the vegetation
		index-based models (80%–85% vs 65%–79% accuracy). Errors were mainly false
		positives attributed to pixels with green understory vegetation but no live
		trees. In cross-site inference, which involved pooling two sites for model
		calibration to test on the third site, the all bands model retained good
		performance (76%–81% accuracy). Evaluation against field survey data
		demonstrated a larger range of performance (50%–87% accuracy) that highlights
		limitations based on tree isolation and crown percent greenness. Relative to
		differential-based VIs, our results highlight potential advantages of using
		post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery and random forest modeling for identifying live

		each site and in each year. In these experiments, we varied planting density,
		variety, mulching, ridging, and fertilizer application, as management options
		to increase productivity. Spectral vegetation indices extracted from early
		season weed cover were used to predict soil organic matter.ResultsVariation
		in spectral vegetation indices from early season weed cover was higher in
		Bognaayili than in Gauwogo. Predicted soil organic matter from a model built
		with spectral vegetation indices had a significant relationship (Radj2 =
		0.54) with measured soil organic matter in Bognaayili, but not in Gauwogo. In
		Bognaayili, predicted soil organic matter was significantly and positively
		correlated with soybean above-ground biomass in 2022 (r = 0.53) and 2023 (r =
		0.65). There was no relationship observed between predicted soil organic
		matter and maize above-ground biomass.ConclusionsThe use of spectral

		within-field variation in soil organic matter is a promising option although
		it still requires some soil sampling for organic matter analysis.
		Incorporating drone-based early season weed cover assessment into field crop

		delineation of areas with lower or higher productivity in regions where soil
		organic matter is limiting crop productivity.

		Antarctic krill is critical to the Antarctic ecosystem and the target of a
		growing fishery. To minimize the impact of fishing on the ecosystem,
		cost-effective monitoring is essential. In this study, we developed a method
		to detect krill predators diving beneath fishing vessels. This allowed us to
		analyze predator-vessel encounters at very large scales. We found that the
		seasonality and distribution of encounters were highly predator-specific and
		that existing protection measures were ineffective in protecting breeding
		penguins during the summer. We therefore not only provide insights into the
		overlap of predators and vessel in the krill fishery but also present an
		approach to data collection that can inform fisheries management at low cost.
		Antarctic krill is a keystone species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and
		the target of a growing fishery. Given the ecological importance of krill,
		concerns have been raised about potential negative impacts of fishing on the
		Southern Ocean ecosystem. Resource-efficient approaches to fisheries
		monitoring are particularly valuable in this context due to the high costs
		associated with data collection in Antarctica. In this study, we trained a
		segmentation model (U-Net) to extract dives of air-breathing krill predators
		from more than 30,000 h of active acoustic data collected by three krill
		fishing vessels over six years. We were able to characterize the temporal and
		spatial dynamics of predator-vessel co-occurrences, which aligned well with
		the findings from more costly tracking studies. For example, we found that
		encounters with whales consistently peaked in autumn around the Antarctic
		Peninsula, when whales are building up fat reserves for their migration to
		breeding grounds. We also demonstrated that protection measures, introduced
		to protect breeding penguins at the Antarctic Peninsula, have simply shifted
		penguin-vessel encounters to the South Orkney Islands, where the affected
		colonies are not currently monitored. Our approach, results, and application
		example demonstrate how acoustic data from fishing vessels can provide
		important information to support fisheries management. As a by-product of
		fishing operations, these data are cost-effective, offering unique temporal
		and spatial coverage and providing a useful basis for rapid, low-level
		assessments of the fishery’s interaction with the wider ecosystem. This is
		particularly important given the unpredictable dynamics of krill fishery
		management decision-making.

		map at a 16 m × 16 m spatial resolution. Parametrization of the model for the

		Inventory data. This new parametrization of the model for Norwegian forests
		yielded estimates of CWS significantly different from the default
		parametrization. Both parametrizations fell short of providing acceptable

		the central southern region of Norway when using unadjusted CWS. After
		adjusting the CWS and the storm wind speeds by a constant factor, the
		Norwegian parametrization provided acceptable discrimination and was thus
		defined as suitable to use in future studies, despite the lack of field- and
		laboratory experiments to directly derive parameters for Norwegian forests.
		The windstorm event used for model validation in this study highlighted the
		challenges of predicting wind damage to forests in landscapes with complex
		topography. Future studies should focus on further developing ForestGALES and
		new datasets describing extreme wind climates to better represent the wind
		and tree interactions in complex topography, and predict the level of risk in

		Abstract

		Background

		Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are mosquito-borne nematodes with dogs as
		primary hosts, but other mammalian species including humans can be also
		infected. In the last century, circulation of both pathogens was
		predominantly restricted to Southern Europe. However, different studies
		indicated a potential establishment in Central, Eastern and Western parts of
		Europe as an increasing threat to animal and human health. Therefore, we
		conducted a systematic literature review of Dirofilaria data in Europe to
		give a comprehensive overview of potential mosquito vectors and vertebrate
		hosts, including the collection of different metadata (e.g. sampling year and
		site), allowing to analyse the spread pattern of the parasites in Europe.

		Methods

		On 24 January 2022, we conducted a systematic literature review of all
		available publications in the PubMed database reporting D. immitis and D.
		repens screening in mosquitoes and mammalian vertebrates in Europe. We only
		included acute infection of Dirofilaria spp., i.e. excluding studies only
		screening antibodies, and in addition noted the travel history and the
		accuracy of the sampling locations. These data were used to analyse the range
		of potential vectors and hosts and for a comparison of the spatial
		distribution between the twentieth and twenty-first century.

		Results

		Both nematodes appear to have a high overlap of Aedes , Anopheles and Culex
		as potential vector species, which are abundant in Europe. Most published D.
		immitis infections were reported in dogs, while D. repens predominantly were
		reported in humans. Dirofilaria immitis infections were detected in a wider
		range of wild and zoo animals. Compared to the last century, many more
		countries especially in Central Europe were affected by Dirofilaria spp.
		circulation, illustrating a significant spread over the last 20 years.

		Conclusions

		Our findings suggest that D. immitis and D. repens are a growing health
		concern for animals and humans in Europe. Continuous globalisation and
		climate warming will probably lead to a further spread and increased
		circulation in the future. All data are made available open access, which
		will enable further analysis.

		Abstract Reservoirs serve critical roles providing drinking water,
		irrigation, flood control, hydropower, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic
		habitat. Yet their physical position, complex shape, and large watersheds
		make reservoirs especially susceptible to eutrophication and harmful algal
		bloom (HAB) production. Boysen Reservoir, WY, is a high priority for
		proactive nutrient management because it is an important source for drinking
		water and recreation, and has a history of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. We
		combined four years of comprehensive monitoring efforts by state and federal
		agencies to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient inflow,
		internal water quality dynamics, and phytoplankton community shifts in Boysen
		Reservoir. We found nutrient inflow was hydrologically driven, with snowmelt
		runoff transporting high nutrient loads. Our findings suggest physicochemical
		and nutrient conditions of the reservoir were strongly different between the
		furthest reaches of the reservoir, but less variable among the intermediate
		sites. Space did not play a role in phytoplankton community dynamics, but
		time was an important factor. Cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton
		communities by mid-summer across the reservoir and were driven mainly by
		temporal physicochemical conditions, like stratification and water
		temperature. The two most dominant phytoplankton taxa across the four years
		of sampling were N-fixing, toxin producing cyanobacteria. Extensive
		monitoring efforts and data analyses can illuminate strategies to safeguard
		water resources via understanding the drivers of water quality changes and
		HAB production.

		Abstract

		Spatial and temporal variation in fine‐scale environmental conditions can
		influence local population abundance and structure ecological communities. In
		temperate deciduous forests, some herbaceous plant species, including some
		spring ephemerals, locally cluster around the bases of canopy trees. Despite
		the conspicuousness of this pattern, no experimental tests have been
		conducted to discriminate among hypothesized mechanisms.

		We tested whether earlier spring snowmelt in rings around the base of
		deciduous trees (‘thaw circles’) was responsible for improved plant
		performance and greater local abundance via advanced spring phenology and
		longer growing seasons (the time between emergence and either senescence or
		canopy closure). Individuals of Dutchman's breeches ( Dicentra cucullaria ),
		a common spring ephemeral plant, were transplanted into a fully factorial
		field experiment of manipulated snowmelt timing (early vs. late) and tree
		proximity (near vs. far) in a temperate deciduous forest (Québec, Canada).
		Spring phenology and plant performance (peak leaf‐bearing stem abundance and
		total leaf area) were tracked for 2 years.

		Advanced spring emergence with early snowmelt, in both naturally occurring
		thaw circles and where snow was experimentally removed, lengthened growing
		seasons by 10\%–19\%, a meaningful extension for spring‐flowering herbs with
		a short window of activity. Surprisingly, Dutchman's breeches transplanted
		near trees experienced lengthened growing seasons as well, even after
		accounting for snowmelt timing and stem abundance. However, leaf area and
		stem abundance increased only with close tree proximity, with no effects of
		snowmelt timing on these aspects of performance.

		Synthesis . Growing season length was disconnected from Dutchman's breeches'
		performance, with early snowmelt likely not the proximate cause of greater
		local abundance of this spring ephemeral herb around the base of deciduous
		trees. Instead, other factors associated with tree proximity, including
		edaphic conditions and microclimate buffering, may play a primary role in
		Dutchman's breeches' local distribution. Experimental manipulation of
		fine‐scale environmental conditions and resource availability will prove
		increasingly informative for understanding population dynamics and community
		structuring in an era of rapid global change.

		Introduction

		Climate change represents an escalating threat to wildlife globally,
		disrupting ecosystems and altering species interactions. Key nut-producing
		forest species in the Cantabrian Mountains may be affected, with consequences
		for Cantabrian brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) during hyperphagia. Understanding
		such changes may help to improve conservation strategies to ensure that bears
		may be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

		Methods With this aim, we assessed the current and future habitat suitability
		of all nut-producing trees in the Cantabrian Mountains. We fitted species
		distribution models using a down-sampling random forest ensemble approach to
		create comprehensive maps and species flows, identifying key hotspots of nut
		production under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 climate change scenarios. Based on
		bear mobility patterns, we identified areas where individuals lacked access
		to at least two fruit-producing species, thereby identifying potential areas
		of nuts shortage for bears during hyperphagia.

		Results and discussion

		We anticipate a potential decline in beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) and Atlantic
		oaks ( Quercus petraea ), with a compositional shift towards thermophilic
		species, such as sweet chestnuts ( Castanea sativa ) and Mediterranean oaks
		(e.g. Quercus ilex ). The area unsuitable for any nut-producing species is
		likely to increase over time, reaching 25\% \% within the current bear range.
		The diversity of nut-producing species is projected to decline over time,
		leaving large areas within the bear’s range with access to only one or two
		species. Bears may be able to gain access to food resources owing to their
		dietary plasticity and their ability to move and track energy-rich food
		resources. Ensuring the long-term accessibility of nuts to bears in some
		areas could be based on the establishment of Chestnut plantations apart from
		human settlements, as well as actions to enhance fruiting for oaks, such as
		the case of Pyrenean oaks.

		Summary

		We aggregated digitized herbarium and other collection records – spanning
		{\textgreater} 225 yr since 1795 – to assess the biological, geographical,
		and historical factors shaping distributions of three wild tomato species on
		the Galápagos Islands, and to infer future threats to the two endemic species
		( Solanum cheesmaniae and Solanum galapagense ) and risks posed by their
		invasive congener ( Solanum pimpinellifolium ).

		Combining {\textgreater} 400 unique geolocated Galápagos records with
		bioclimate data and species distribution modelling, we quantified the
		geo‐spatial distribution of each species, bracketed the historical timing and
		location of introductions of the invasive species, characterized species
		bioclimate envelopes, and projected suitable habitat overlap.

		We infer that dispersal limitation and alternative selective histories shape
		current species distributions, and that anthropogenic change has and will
		continue to have different impacts on the two endemic species – closely
		associated with their different geographic and environmental distributions.
		We also identify plausible avenues for, and limits to, future invasive
		expansion.

		These data vastly extend the temporal and spatial reach of our direct
		historical inferences, provide a critical complement to genomic analyses of
		contemporary Galápagos populations, and demonstrate that scientific
		collections are especially valuable for interpreting factors shaping species
		distributions on high‐endemism islands with recent rapid environmental
		change.

		Abstract

		Background Biological data at different levels of organization is essential
		to support actions to mitigate the current biodiversity crisis. DNA
		metabarcoding is an established method to detect species/genus level taxa
		from bulk samples leading the way for a Biomonitoring 2.0 framework.
		Biomonitoring 2.0 Refined adds another dimension to Biomonitoring
		2.0—high-throughput, scalable DNA metabarcoding with a higher resolution at
		the intraspecific level. Intraspecific diversity is key to understanding the
		distribution and movement of local populations for conservation efforts.
		Gaining reliable intraspecific information from metabarcoding data, however,
		is challenging due to qualitative/quantitative issues that can impact
		validity of the inference.

		Results

		Samples collected for the STREAM community-based monitoring project were used
		to perform an intraspecific genetic variation analysis on benthic arthropods.
		We targeted two non-overlapping cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial
		DNA amplicons to assess the reproducibility of our results. Samples from the
		Rocky Mountains were grouped into four regions separated by mountain ranges.
		Significant separation (PERMANOVA, p value {\textless} 0.05) of Sørensen
		dissimilarity between regions was observed for community and intraspecific
		levels, fitting the expectation that mountains are barriers to dispersal. Two
		of the regions showed significant spatial structuring (Mantel test, p
		value {\textless} 0.05) at the intraspecific level, while all regions showed
		significant structuring at the community level. Results were consistent
		across both amplicons.

		Conclusions We show that DNA metabarcoding is applicable to intraspecific
		diversity analysis and it is robust to different amplicons. This paves the
		way for Biomonitoring 2.0 Refined, which can provide much needed fine-scale
		biodiversity data for ecological assessments and conservation.

		Abstract Climate change is causing the loss or movement of suitable habitats,
		forcing species to undergo range shifts. However, many may be unable to move
		to suitable locations, resulting in increased extinctions. Climate refugia,
		areas maintaining suitable conditions for species now and in the future,
		offer protection from climate change. These refugia are categorised as in
		situ, where species are currently present, and ex situ, where they are not.
		Identifying these areas is vital and they could serve as relocation sites for
		species unable to migrate naturally. We aimed to identify climate refugia for
		rare vascular plant species in Britain and examined whether refugia with the
		highest number of suitable species share any common features. Using predicted
		2080 distributions, we identified protected areas in Britain that act as in
		situ or ex situ refugia for 12 of Plantlife’s focal plant species. This study
		revealed that many current habitats will become unsuitable by 2080,
		highlighting the urgent need to protect refugia. The limited availability of
		in situ refugia underscores the importance of ex situ refugia as potential
		habitats. Given Britain’s fragmented protected areas and species’ low
		dispersal rates, translocations may be necessary to move threatened species
		to ex situ refugia. Our findings indicated that protected areas with higher
		elevations, larger elevational ranges, higher latitude and longitude and
		larger area will provide climate refugia for a greater number of species.
		This information can be used to guide the selection and management of
		protected areas and identify receptor sites for species introductions.

		Abstract Effective disaster planning strengthens community resilience and
		reduces both damage and casualties from tsunamis. In Puerto Rico, municipal
		emergency management planners need data on the tsunami evacuation zone (TEZ),
		wave run-up heights, and estimated evacuation times to inform constituents.
		There are 46 coastal municipalities within the TEZ. Due to evolving
		methodologies, software, and staffing, the Puerto Rico Seismic Network’s
		TsunamiReady Program has only provided walking-time estimates to a subset of
		communities. This study introduces an effective, repeatable methodology to
		generate distance to safety and pedestrian evacuation times across all
		impacted zones. The approach—an iterative least-cost path analysis from road
		points to safety areas, followed by spatial interpolation—produced evacuation
		time maps for all 46 municipalities. The longest modeled evacuation time was
		184 min in Loíza, though average times across most municipalities were under
		35 min. For comparison, historical tsunami evidence suggests that waves can
		reach Puerto Rico’s western coast within 2 to 45 min of a generating event.
		The open-source methodology used here is transferable to other tsunami-prone
		regions and offers significant advantages over proprietary systems. The
		results provide Puerto Rico’s emergency managers, and the public, with
		essential spatial information to identify the highest-risk portions of their
		TEZ and improve evacuation planning.

		Local livestock breeds are valuable genetic resources that support ecosystem
		services, cultural identity, and the sustainability of animal husbandry.
		However, these populations face increasing threats from intensive farming,
		land abandonment, and environmental risks. This study aimed to assess Italian
		small ruminant populations’ exposure to environmental threats and
		distribution across different landscapes. Therefore, we integrated
		geolocation data of 3,712 active registered farms of 41 goat and 47 sheep
		breeds with publicly available data on environmental hazards, including
		seismic activity, landslides, floods, and projected climate change, alongside
		landscape characterization maps of Italy. Additionally, we evaluated
		extinction risks based on effective population size (Ne) and calculated
		biodiversity indices at the provincial level to describe small ruminant
		biodiversity in Italy. Our findings indicate that over a quarter of Italian
		small ruminant populations are at short-term risk of extinction, while nearly
		half face long-term threats. The two most pressing environmental concerns
		include seismic risk, particularly for breeds in southern Italy, and climate
		change projections indicating shifts to warmer and drier conditions,
		especially for Alpine breeds traditionally adapted to colder environments.
		Landscape characterization revealed that sheep farming is predominantly
		associated with agricultural landscapes, whereas goat farms are more
		frequently linked to woodlands and mountainous areas. Each breed exhibits
		specific environmental adaptations, underscoring their role in sustainable
		land management. Biodiversity analyses highlighted significant regional
		disparities, with high diversity in provinces such as Cuneo and Frosinone,
		whereas others exhibit limited breed representation. Understanding the
		spatial distribution of local breeds, their exposure to environmental risks,
		and their interactions with landscapes is essential for developing targeted
		conservation strategies. Integrating ecological, genetic, and spatial data
		allows for effective prioritization of conservation efforts to safeguard
		genetic diversity, support rural communities, and promote sustainable
		livestock farming.

		Soil pH indicates the level of acidity or alkalinity in the soil environment,
		influencing various biogeochemical and physical processes. Additionally, soil
		pH levels are crucial in determining the bioavailability of elements such as
		iron, aluminium, and heavy metals which can be harmful. As such, pH is an
		important soil health and degradation indicator. Although there is a
		well-established understanding of soil pH at localized levels, the spatial
		and temporal variations, as well as significant thresholds at national and
		continental scales, are not sufficiently documented. Here we analyse the
		European topsoil pH data (LUCAS) in combination with other soil properties
		from the LUCAS survey, to identify thresholds and spatial patterns of soil pH
		across Europe in relation to soil health and degradation. At the European
		scale we found: 1) the water balance, calculated as mean annual precipitation
		minus potential evapotranspiration (MAP-PET), provides essential context to
		interpret soil pH; 2) the shift from organic carbon-rich soils to those
		dominated by inorganic carbon is observed at a pH of about 7.2, however, soil
		moisture levels may be more critical than pH for the accumulation of soil
		organic carbon; 3) we identified three distinct clusters within the
		multivariate regression tree: acidophiles (below pH 5.2), neutrophiles (pH
		5.2–6.9) and alkaliphiles (above pH 6.9), while optimum microbial diversity
		occurred between pH 6 and 7. Earthworm abundance, as reported by the sWorm
		database, is more nuanced and dependent on land use; 4) risk of degradation
		by heavy metals cannot be captured by a single pH threshold. Finally, we
		identify soil pH thresholds that can aid policymakers in identifying regions
		that may require protection or intervention.
