		Environments are changing at an accelerated rate, as a consequence of hu- man
		activity. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the drivers of this
		change in the landscape, the mechanisms by which species are affected, and
		patterns of consequential species vulnerabilities. Here I use remote sensing
		and machine learning to investigate pathways of savannah degradation; use
		Bayesian species distribution models with data integration to test predictors
		of range shifts in savannah birds; and evaluate a common climate change vul-
		nerability assessment framework based on simulated data and foundational
		concepts. I find that the most degraded savannah sites are those that de-
		cline in resistance over time and tend to exhibit lower rainfall and higher
		human and livestock density. However, I show that the same sites do not lose
		their recovery potential, giving hope for their eventual restoration under
		correct management. I find that degradation has increased across the whole
		landscape, and that this increase was lowest for national parks and wildlife
		management areas, underlining the effectiveness of these management strate-
		gies for mitigating current degradation trends. Next, I find little support
		for broad trait-range shift relationships across taxa, for either local
		extinctions, local colonisations, or total change. This calls into question
		the usefulness of traits in vulnerability assessments of taxa, where they are
		applied to wider taxonomic groups. However, I also identify strong
		species-specific relation- ships among the results, suggesting that more
		research into those individual species might reveal important trait
		relationships. Finally, I show that vulner- ability frameworks based on
		separately assessed species sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity,
		such as many trait-based approaches, are fundamen- tally unable to accurately
		predict true vulnerability of species. I showcase how recent advances in
		species distribution modelling can be applied to develop revised
		vulnerability metrics.

		Background Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are mosquito-borne nematodes
		with dogs as primary hosts, but other mammalian species including humans can
		be also infected. In the last century, circulation of both pathogens was
		predominantly restricted to Southern Europe. However, different studies
		indicated a potential establishment in Central, Eastern and Western parts of
		Europe as an increasing threat to animal and human health.Methods We
		conducted a systematic literature review of publications reporting D. immitis
		and D. repens screening in mosquitoes and mammalian vertebrates in Europe.
		These data were used to analyse the range of vectors and hosts and for a
		comparison of the spatial distribution between the 20th and 21st
		century.Results Both nematodes appear to have a high overlap of Aedes,
		Anopheles and Culex vector species, which are abundant in Europe. Most D.
		immitis infections were reported in dogs, while D. repens predominated in
		humans. Dirofilaria immitis infections were detected in a wider range of wild
		and zoo animals. Compared to the last century, many more countries especially
		in Central Europe were affected by Dirofilaria spp. circulation, illustrating
		a significant spread over the last 20 years.Conclusion Our findings suggest
		that D. immitis and D. repens are a growing health concern for animals and
		humans in Europe. Continuous globalisation and climate warming will probably
		lead to a further spread and increased circulation in the future. All data
		are made available open access, which will enable further analysis in the
		future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing

		In recent decades, the Pyrenees have experienced an increase in
		archaeological research that has made it possible to identify new sites with
		Neolithic chronology in different parts of the mountain range, in some cases
		with signs of agricultural practices. These new archaeological data have
		begun to fill gaps in knowledge in a context in which, until the end of the
		20th century, the Balma Margineda was practically the only known Neolithic
		site in the Pyrenees, and in the knowledge of the first agricultural and
		livestock farming communities that inhabited the mountain range. These new
		studies allow us to question and propose new alternative scenarios to the
		historical and traditional views that have considered mountain environments
		such as the Pyrenees as marginal areas and only frequented by seasonal
		livestock farming groups during the summer. Based on this issue, this
		doctoral thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge of the introduction of
		agricultural and livestock practices of these first human groups, from a
		geographical perspective of the territory. In other words, it aims to
		spatially contextualize the settlements and analyses how the different land
		occupation patterns were configured throughout the Neolithic period (5700 -
		2100 cal BCE), applying different methods and techniques of Geographic
		Information Systems. Two aspects have been taken into account to define the
		land occupation patterns. On the one hand, several orographic and
		palaeoclimatic variables have been processed and analyzed in order to
		identify the geographical parameters and contexts in which the Neolithic
		settlements are located. On the other hand, the agricultural potential of the
		Pyrenees has been spatially modelled, taking into account the requirements of
		different crops and agricultural systems to test the viability of agriculture
		during the different phases of the Neolithic in the different areas of the
		Pyrenees. These methodological developments have made it possible to identify
		two settlement location patterns. The first is associated with the first
		Neolithic occupations with a mixed and diversified economy, with settlements
		linked to areas accessible to land with agricultural potential. On the other
		hand, the second pattern is related to the Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic
		occupations, linked to a livestock use of the subalpine belts.

		Abstract

		Passive approaches to nature recovery have been hailed as a low‐cost approach
		to boosting biodiversity in ecologically degraded sites. But there remains
		little evidence of whether this generalises to all climatic and ecological
		contexts.

		To address this knowledge gap, we used satellite remote sensing to examine
		vegetation change in Alladale Wilderness Reserve, a remote rewilding site in
		Scotland where active and passive approaches have simultaneously taken place
		for the past decades.

		In contrast to enclosures and tree planting, more passive approaches did not
		help regenerate the native Caledonian forest, failing to lead to structural
		or functional change within Alladale, relative to the wider landscape.
		Observed changes under both approaches were moreover much less dramatic than
		those reported for the Knepp Estate, another established rewilding site in
		Southern England.

		Our results suggest that passive rewilding is unlikely to promote significant
		biodiversity change in areas where recent human forcing of ecological
		processes has been limited, even if past human pressures have intensively
		reshaped the ecosystem—as seen in Alladale. In such situations, active
		interventions are likely to be required to shift the system onto a new
		ecological trajectory.

		Altogether, our study illustrates how freely available satellite data can (1)
		help contrast the impacts of environmental management approaches on ecosystem
		structure and functioning, in ways that complement existing ground‐based
		studies; and (2) help distinguish areas likely to benefit from passive nature
		recovery approaches from those where specific active interventions are
		needed.

		ABSTRACT

		This article aims to delineate the wildland–urban interface in the sparsely
		populated, limited‐resourced Scandinavian peninsula (excluding Finland).
		Common WUI mapping assumptions and how different thresholds capture the
		reality of building ignition from wildfire in this region are evaluated. We
		show that dedicated fuel maps capture areas at risk slightly better than
		vegetation maps, although the choice of map per se is less important than the
		selected limit for possible ember transport. The commonly used 6.17
		buildings/km 2 threshold for building density fails to capture most wildfire
		incidents that have led to building ignition.

		Climate change is expected to outpace the rate at which populations of forest
		trees can migrate. Hence, in forestry there is growing interest in
		intervention strategies such as assisted migration to mitigate climate change
		impacts. However, until now the primary focus when evaluating candidates for
		assisted migration has been mean or maximum performance. We explore
		phenotypic plasticity as a potentially new avenue to help maintain the
		viability of species and populations in the face of climate change.
		Capitalizing on large, multi-site international provenance trials of four
		economically and ecologically important forest tree species ( Fagus sylvatica
		, Picea abies , Picea engelmannii , Pinus contorta ), we quantify growth
		stability as the width of the response function relating provenance growth
		performance and trial site climate. We found significant differences in
		growth stability among species, with P. engelmannii being considerably more
		stable than the other three species. Additionally, we found no relationship
		between growth performance and growth stability of provenances, indicating
		that there are fast-growing provenances with a broad climate optimum. In two
		of the four species, provenances’ growth stability showed a significant
		relationship with the climate of the seed source, the direction of which
		depends on the species. When taken together with data on growth performance
		in different climate conditions, a measure of growth stability can improve
		the choice of species and provenances to minimize future risks in forest
		restoration and reforestation.

		Downy mildew is a severe disease that leads to significant losses in grape
		yields worldwide. It is caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. The study
		of the distribution of this agent and the search for endophytic organisms
		that inhibit the growth of P. viticola are essential objectives to facilitate
		the transition to sustainable and high-yield agriculture, while respecting
		the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the ITS
		(ITS1f/ITS2 region) and 16S (V4 region) amplicons was employed to analyze 80
		samples of leaves and stems from different grapevine species and cultivars
		grown in the Russian Far East (Vitis amurensis Rupr., Vitis coignetiae
		Pulliat, and several grapevine cultivars). The analysis revealed the presence
		of P. viticola in 53.75\% of the grape samples. The pathogen P. viticola was
		not detected in V. amurensis samples collected near Vladivostok and Russky
		Island. Among the P. viticola-affected samples, only two (out of the eighty
		analyzed grape samples) from the Makarevich vineyard in Primorsky Krai
		exhibited disease symptoms, while the majority appeared visually healthy. We
		also found six distinct P. viticola ASVs in our metagenomic data. Based on
		phylogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that the P. viticola population in the
		Russian Far East may have originated from the invasive P. viticola clade
		aestivalis, which has spread around the world from North America. To identify
		putative microbial antagonists of P. viticola, a differential analysis of
		high-throughput sequencing data was conducted using the DESeq2 method to
		compare healthy and P. viticola-affected samples. The in silico analysis
		revealed an increased representation of certain taxa in healthy samples
		compared to P. viticola-affected ones: fungi—Kabatina sp., Aureobasidium sp.,
		and Vishniacozyma sp.; bacteria—Hymenobacter spp., Sphingomonas spp.,
		Massilia spp., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum spp., and Chryseobacterium spp.
		This in-silico-obtained information on the potential microbial antagonists of
		P. viticola serves as a theoretical basis for the development of biocontrol
		agents for grapevine downy mildew.

		Abstract

		Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a significant greenhouse gas and the most important
		currently emitted ozone depleting substance, primarily via agricultural
		fertilization. Current N 2 O emission estimation methods at the national
		scale are predominantly via emission factors. Models estimating
		national‐scale emissions are focused on growing season emissions. However, a
		substantial fraction of N 2 O can be emitted during non‐growing season
		periods. Using newly published off‐season N 2 O emission ratio maps and
		high‐resolution nitrogen application data, this study explores the potential
		magnitude of underestimated N 2 O emissions if using only the default
		growing‐season focused methodology. Although there is large variation at
		county scales (12\%–35\%), non‐growing season national emissions are
		estimated at 31\% of the total, a potential 12,000 Gg CO 2 e year −1 .
		Further work should better refine emission estimates spatially as well as
		fully integrate estimates across growing and non‐growing seasons.

		, Core Ideas

		Offseason direct N 2 O emissions are significant but under‐quantified, and
		vary across space.

		Inclusion of offseason N 2 O raises net maize emissions 31\% on average in
		the United States.

		Estimated undercounting of offseason maize N 2 O emissions is approximately
		12,000 Gg CO 2 e year −1 .

		There are significant policy implications with annual N2O, given the
		importance of maize to food, fuel, and fiber.

		, Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important
		greenhouse gas. Most comes from agriculture, and so understanding how much
		nitrous oxide is being produced is important to managing climate change.
		However, most of the time we only measure the gas during the growing season.
		But other times, like winter, produce N2O also. If we don't include
		non‐growing season times in our count, we could be underestimating N2O by
		around 31\%. This has real implications for sustainable agriculture and
		biofuels, because if we are missing a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions we
		may make the wrong decisions about policy and management.

		Invasive species represent a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem
		conservation, with their impacts often amplified in island ecosystems.
		Species distribution models (SDMs) can infer the potential habitat throughout
		the life of an organism and are considered a valuable tool for predicting the

		ensemble of four presence–absence models (GLM, GAM, Random Forest, and BART)
		calibrated only with data collected in Tenerife, the island with the best
		representation of the species, to infer the habitat suitability for Pluchea
		ovalis (Pers.) DC. (Asteraceae). Subsequently, we transferred the ensembled

		under near-present conditions, the suitable areas are in the coastal and
		mid-elevations of the south slope sectors of Tenerife and Gran Canarian
		Islands, as well as a vast portion of the westernmost and drier islands,
		always coinciding with ravines and highly disturbed ecosystems. In addition,
		we forecasted the potential distribution of Pluchea ovalis under different
		climate change conditions (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585), showing how its

		ABSTRACT Soil organic matter (SOM) was the primary component of the global
		terrestrial carbon sink. Soil enzymes were important drivers of soil
		metabolism facilitating the materials cycling and the energy flow in soils.
		However, the relationship between soil enzymes and SOM composition in various
		land use types had not been clearly understood. In the current study,
		pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py‐GC/MS) was used to analyze
		the SOM composition of three land use types (grassland, forest, and cropland)
		and the relationship between soil enzyme activity and SOM composition in the
		upper watershed of Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. The activity of C‐cycling
		enzymes glucosidase, cellobiose glycosidase, xylosidase, P‐cycling enzyme
		alkaline phosphatase, and N‐cycling enzyme leucine aminopeptidase in
		grassland was the highest but the activity of S‐cycling enzyme
		methylumbelliferryl sulfate potassium salt was lowest in grassland. The
		activity of N‐cycling enzyme leucine aminopeptidase was the highest in
		forest. Aliphatic (23.1\%–25.1\%), N‐compounds (16.69\%–21.17\%), and
		aromatic (11.76\%–12.61\%) were the most abundant SOM components in the three
		land use types and the complexity of SOM molecular network in forest was the
		highest. Additionally, all the C‐cycling enzymes and N‐cycling enzyme
		acetylglucosaminidase were significantly positively related to the proportion

		Myotis yumanensis is a small insectivorous bat distributed in Western North
		America and is susceptible to white-nose syndrome, a devastating fungal
		disease. Effective management of the disease in M. yumanensis requires an
		understanding of its population structure to identify possible routes and
		barriers of disease transmission. Here we used nine microsatellite loci to
		investigate genetic variation among 336 M. yumanensis from 10 locations in
		Western Canada. Our analyses revealed high genetic diversity and low but
		statistically significant genetic differentiation among several geographic
		populations. Interestingly, though geographically it was not the most
		distant, the Lillooet population showed the highest genetic differentiation
		from others, suggesting factors other than geographic distance also
		contributed to gene flow in this species. While white-nose syndrome has been
		reported in M. yumanensis populations in neighbouring Washington State in the
		United States of America, as of 2023, the causative pathogen was not detected
		on the wings of our analyzed 336 M. yumanensis bats in Western Canada.
		However, continuing monitoring is required to provide the most updated
		information about the white-nose syndrome status in these populations. The
		knowledge of M. yumanensis population structure in Western Canada will help
		develop effective management strategies for protecting this bat species from
		white-nose syndrome.

		the Caribbean. We derived optimal climatic, edaphic and socio-economic
		conditions from the distribution of intensive banana production across Latin
		America and the Caribbean, identified using remote sensing imagery. We found
		that intensive banana production is constrained to low-lying, warm aseasonal
		regions with slightly acidic soils, but is less constrained by precipitation,
		as irrigation facilitates production in drier regions. Production is limited
		to areas close to shipping ports and with high human population density.
		Rising temperatures, coupled with requirements for labour and export

		export banana production, along with yield declines in most current banana

		Abstract Background The incidence of human infections caused by
		arthropod-borne viruses, such as the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has increased
		globally due to a number of factors, such as climate change and
		globalization. The exotic mosquito species Aedes albopictus is a significant
		vector for CHIKV, raising concerns about its transmission potential in
		temperate regions, including Central Europe. We have therefore investigated
		the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for CHIKV at constant and fluctuating
		temperatures between 15 °C and 24 °C to assess the transmission risk in
		Europe. Methods Aedes albopictus mosquitoes were reared and artificially
		infected with CHIKV. Infection rates and transmission efficiencies (TEs) were
		determined after 14 days of incubation at constant and fluctuating (± 5 °C)
		mean temperatures of 15 °C, 18 °C, 21 °C and 24 °C. In addition, mosquito
		locomotor activity was measured under the same fluctuating temperature
		conditions. A risk map for CHIKV transmission in Europe was generated
		combining temperature data and the current distribution of Ae. albopictus .
		Results CHIKV transmission was observed at all tested temperatures. The
		highest TEs were recorded at fluctuating temperatures of 18 °C (54.3\%) and
		21 °C (58.6\%), while the lowest TE was observed at a constant temperature of
		15 °C (5.6\%). TEs at fluctuating temperatures of 15 °C and 24 °C were the
		same (32.5\%). Mosquito activity showed a nocturnal unimodal activity pattern
		with a peak during the start of the scotophase (hour 20). The proportion of
		active mosquitoes per hour increased with temperature and was nearly zero at
		15 °C. The risk map indicated that regions in Southern and Central Europe,
		including recently invaded areas north of the Alps, have temperatures
		theoretically allowing CHIKV transmission for at least some days per year.
		Conclusions While CHIKV can be transmitted by Ae. albopictus at 15 °C, the
		activity of this mosquito is strongly decreased at this temperature, likely
		reducing the transmission risk. These findings emphasize the importance of
		considering both vector competence and mosquito activity when assessing the
		risk of arbovirus transmission in temperate regions. Further studies are
		needed to validate these laboratory findings under field conditions.

		Species distribution models (SDMs) are used for understanding where species
		live or could potentially live and are a key resource for ecological research
		and conservation decision-making. However, current SDM methods often perform
		poorly for rare or inadequately sampled species, which includes most species
		on earth as well as most of those of the greatest conservation concern.Here,
		we evaluate the performance of three recently developed modeling approaches
		specifically designed for data-deficient situations: 1) plug-and-play
		modeling, 2) density-ratio modeling, and 3) environmental-range modeling. We
		compare the performance of these methods with Maxent, a widely used method.
		We compare model performance across sample sizes as well as comparisons
		limited to only data-poor species. We also ask to what extent model
		cross-validation performance on training data was correlated with model
		performance on independent, presence-absence data.We show that, across all
		species, one or more of the plug-and-play, density-ratio, or
		environmental-range algorithms outperformed Maxent in 72\% of cases, with
		three of the algorithms having AUC distributions not significantly different
		from Maxent{\textquoteright}s. For data-poor species (those with 20 or fewer
		occurrences), 24 of the algorithms considered had AUC distributions that were
		not significantly different from Maxent. However, despite these comparable
		AUC scores, we found that the algorithm outputs (when thresholded to predict
		presence vs absence) spanned a wide gradient of sensitivity vs. specificity.
		Specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on training data were strongly
		correlated with specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on independent
		presence-absence data, however AUC and sensitivity had weak correlations. We
		found that only for 16\% of species was the model that performed best on the
		training data the best performing model when evaluated on independent,
		presence-absence data. Finally, we show how ensembles of models that span the
		sensitivity-specificity gradient can represent model disagreement in poorly
		sampled species and improve model predictions.This work supports
		plug-and-play, density-ratio, and environmental-range modeling as useful
		alternatives to Maxent, particularly for data-deficient species. While our
		work suggests that identifying the best model for a given species is
		challenging, we argue that incorporating the predictions of multiple models
		provides a useful way forward.Data/Code for peer review Anonymized data and

		Abstract

		Premise

		Many angiosperms have evolved specialized systems that promote pollination by
		specific taxa. Therefore, plant distributions may be limited by the local
		abundance of their specialist pollinators. In eastern North America, Lobelia
		cardinalis is thought to be pollinated solely by Archilochus colubris , the
		only hummingbird species found in the region. Here we tested the hypothesis
		that the distribution of a plant species with specialized pollination is
		controlled by the range and abundance of its specialist pollinator.

		Methods

		We investigated the importance of A. colubris abundance, sourced from eBird,
		as a variable in a MaxEnt species distribution model of L. cardinalis using
		presence data from iNaturalist. We also compared hummingbird abundance
		between locations of L. cardinalis and congeneric during their respective
		flowering periods and explored whether the flowering periods of L. cardinalis
		and congenerics align with the week of peak local hummingbird abundance.

		Results

		Unexpectedly, MaxEnt modelling did not suggest that A. colubris abundance is
		a key driver of the species distribution. Lobelia cardinalis habitat
		suitability was lowest in the absence of A. colubris and increased with
		increasing abundance, but habitat suitability was also low in regions where
		hummingbird abundance is highest. Still, hummingbird abundance at L.
		cardinalis locations was generally higher than most congenerics, and L.
		cardinalis tended to flower near the week of local peak A. colubris
		abundance.

		Conclusions While populations of hummingbird‐pollinated plant species may
		require the local presence of hummingbirds, fine‐scale variation in
		hummingbird abundance may not strongly influence their spatial distributions.

		ABSTRACT The aim of the study was to assess amphibian sampling completeness
		and the overlap of sampling completeness categories with natural protected
		areas (NPAs) and key biodiversity areas (KBAs) at global scale. We evaluated
		amphibian sampling completeness across six of the earth's eight biogeographic
		realms to identify well-sampled, under-sampled, and data-gap areas in the
		context of global amphibian distribution. Additionally, we examined the
		spatial overlap of each sampling category with NPAs and KBAs. The Nearctic
		and Australasian realms had the highest number of records and well-sampled
		areas. Significant data gaps were identified, particularly in the
		Afrotropical, Indo-Malayan, Neotropical, and Palearctic realms. We found low
		levels of spatial match (< 35\%) between classified areas and NPAs/KBAs.
		Amphibian distribution data are largely incomplete, with the most extensive
		gaps in the most species-rich realms: Neotropic, Indo-Malayan, and
		Afrotropical. The low overlap between under-sampled and data-gap areas with
		NPAs and KBAs suggests that these regions, critical for amphibian diversity,
		are insufficiently represented within established conservation priorities.
		Given the urgent threats to biodiversity from global change, rapid responses
		are essential to enhance our understanding of species distributions and
		community structures in amphibians. This study provides spatial insights to
		help identify key data-gap areas for amphibian research and conservation
		prioritization.

		Identifying live tree presence following wildfire is important for burn
		damage assessments and decision making, as these trees serve as seed sources
		for recovery. Satellite-based remote sensing offers an efficient means to
		assess burn severity with products representing vegetation greenness and
		char/ash presence and their change from pre- to post-fire imagery. While
		effective at assessing burn severity (e.g. ecosystem change), there remain
		limitations in identifying fire refugia (surviving trees), due to the
		difficulty of teasing apart different green vegetation types (e.g. trees,
		shrubs, grasses). In this paper, we use 10 m Sentinel-2 satellite data to
		predict live tree presence across three sites impacted by the 2021 California
		fire season. We used vegetation indices (VIs) from post-fire imagery
		(normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], normalized burn ratio [NBR],
		normalized difference water index [NDWI], visible atmospherically resistant
		index [VARI], and burn area index [BAI]), differential VIs from pre- and
		post-fire imagery (dNDVI, dNBR, RdNBR, dNDWI, dVARI), and direct reflectance
		bands (all bands model; visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared;
		B1–B12) to predict live tree presence via random forest modeling. To
		calibrate and validate the random forest models, we photointerpreted ∼2300
		pixels per fire region using 2022 National Agriculture Imagery Program
		imagery. We performed additional field-based validation using tree
		presence/absence data two years post-fire (n = 296 observations across two
		sites). At the site level, the all bands model outperformed the vegetation
		index-based models (80%–85% vs 65%–79% accuracy). Errors were mainly false
		positives attributed to pixels with green understory vegetation but no live
		trees. In cross-site inference, which involved pooling two sites for model
		calibration to test on the third site, the all bands model retained good
		performance (76%–81% accuracy). Evaluation against field survey data
		demonstrated a larger range of performance (50%–87% accuracy) that highlights
		limitations based on tree isolation and crown percent greenness. Relative to
		differential-based VIs, our results highlight potential advantages of using
		post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery and random forest modeling for identifying live
		tree presence and scaling to full fire extents.
