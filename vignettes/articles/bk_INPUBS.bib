		Grasslands across the African continent are under pressure from climate
		change and human activities, particularly in arid ecosystems. From a remote
		sensing perspective, these ecosystems have not received much scientific
		attention, especially in Namibia. To address this knowledge gap, various
		remote sensing methods were implemented using new generation spaceborne
		imaging spectrometers amongst others. Therefore, this research provides a
		first methodological approach aimed at mapping and evaluating the
		distribution of grasslands within two private nature reserves, namely, the
		NamibRand Nature Reserve (NRNR) and ProNamib Nature Reserve (PNNR) with
		surrounding farmlands on the edge of Namib Sand Sea. The multi-sensor
		approach utilizes Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) and incorporated
		spectral information collected in the field to analyze grasslands. The
		research involves a sensor comparison of multispectral Sentinel-2 and
		PlanetScope data, hyperspectral data from Environmental Mapping and Analysis
		Programme (EnMAP) and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa
		(PRISMA) and an additional data fusion product derived from Sentinel-2 and
		EnMAP imagery based on a Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation
		Hypersharpening method (SFIM-HS). Additionally, a unique spectral library of
		collected field spectra was established and inter-species spectral
		separability and intra-species spectral homogeneity was analyzed. This
		library presents newly published spectra of individual species. Due to dry
		initial conditions, the calculated spectral separability of individual
		grasses is limited, making only a mean endmember feasible for partial
		unmixing. The validation results of satellite comparison show that data
		fusion products (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51 with Normalized Difference Vegetation
		Index (NDVI); R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66 with Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
		(SAVI)) are more suitable for mapping arid grasslands than multispectral or
		hyperspectral data (all R<sup>2</sup> < 0.35). More research is required and
		potential methodological adjustments are discussed to further investigate the
		spatio-temporal dynamics of arid grasslands and to aid conservation efforts
		in the Greater Sossusvlei-Namib Landscape in line with the United Nations
		Decade of Restoration.

		Maps showing the thickness of sediments above the bedrock (depth to bedrock,
		or DTB) are important for many geoscience studies and are necessary for many
		hydrogeological, engineering, mining, and forestry applications. However, it
		can be difficult to accurately estimate DTB in areas with varied topography,
		like lowland and mountainous terrain, because traditional methods of
		predicting bedrock elevation often underestimate or overestimate the
		elevation in rugged or incised terrain. Here, we describe a machine learning
		spatial prediction approach that uses information from traditional digital
		elevation model derived estimates of terrain morphometry and satellite
		imagery, augmented with spatial feature engineering techniques to predict DTB
		across Alberta, Canada. First, compiled measurements of DTB from borehole
		lithologs were used to train a natural language model to predict bedrock
		depth across all available lithologs, significantly increasing the dataset
		size. The combined data were then used for DTB modelling employing several
		algorithms (XGBoost, Random forests, and Cubist) and spatial feature
		engineering techniques, using a combination of geographic coordinates,
		proximity measures, neighbouring points, and spatially lagged DTB estimates.
		Finally, the results were contrasted with DTB predictions based on modelled
		relationships with the auxiliary variables, as well as conventional spatial
		interpolations using inverse-distance weighting and ordinary kriging methods.
		The results show that the use of spatially lagged variables to incorporate
		information from the spatial structure of the training data significantly
		improves predictive performance compared to using auxiliary predictors and/or
		geographic coordinates alone. Furthermore, unlike some of the other tested
		methods such as using neighbouring point locations directly as features,
		spatially lagged variables did not generate spurious spatial artifacts in the
		predicted raster maps. The proposed method is demonstrated to produce
		reliable results in several distinct physiographic sub-regions with
		contrasting terrain types, as well as at the provincial scale, indicating its
		broad suitability for DTB mapping in general.

		Xylophagous insects play a crucial role in forest ecosystems, contributing to

		in Mediterranean oak woodlands. We studied the fragmentation and connectivity
		of holm and cork oak stands in Andalusia (Spain), and the relationships with
		the current dispersion of CC, as well as the effect on the connectivity and
		dispersion patterns with the implementation of nests of a predator bird
		(Garrulus glandarius) to reduce insect populations in highly connected areas.
		The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was used to assess the spatial
		distribution of CC. Connectivity was assessed using graphs theory (Graphab
		2.6) to characterize the importance of patches and linkages for contributing
		to dispersal. We selected the Eurasian jay (G. glandarius) as a reference
		bird species to generate “barriers” to the dispersion of the CC. We used the
		probability of connectivity (PC) and the flux (F) to compare the effect of
		the introduction of Eurasian jay nets. Results showed an increasing trend in
		the distribution and incidence of CC during the period 2001–2016, resulting
		in 7.3% and 13.1% mortality rates for Q. ilex and Q. suber, respectively. The
		connectivity model using only Q. ilex and Q. suber forests as reference
		habitats was not enough to explain the distribution of CC. The value of PC
		and F metrics decreased by 38.09% and 20.59% by introducing 300 nests of
		Eurasian jay. Our methodology provides a pest management tool using
		connectivity metrics, which can be integrated with other variables to control
		pest outbreaks and pest dispersion.

		Urban green spaces are central components of urban ecosystems, providing
		refuge for wildlife while helping `future proof' cities against climate
		change. Conversion of urban green spaces to artificial turf has become
		increasingly popular in various developed countries, such as the UK, leading
		to reduced urban ecosystem services delivery. To date, there is no
		established satellite remote sensing method for reliably detecting and
		mapping artificial turf expansion at scale. We here assess the combined use
		of very high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery and classical, open
		source, supervised classification approaches to map artificial lawns in a
		typical British city. Both object-based and pixel-based classifications
		struggled to reliably detect artificial turf, with large patches of
		artificial turf not being any more reliably identified than small patches of
		artificial turf. As urban ecosystems are increasingly recognised for their
		key contributions to human wellbeing and health, the poor performance of
		these standard methods highlights the urgency of developing and applying new,
		easily accessible approaches for the monitoring of these important
		ecosystems.

		potential of seaweeds, and their current and possible future contribution to
		world food supply. We estimate seaweeds currently provide up to 0.13% of
		global food energy supply. Seaweed production is increasing more rapidly than
		terrestrial production. At current rates of increase we estimate seaweed
		energy contribution of 0.25% in 2050. Production potential of seaweeds could
		contribute up to 2 to 14% of global food supply if farming 1% of the modelled
		suitable space within the Exclusive Economic Zone. We show this large
		potential contribution to world food supply will only be achieved with
		unprecedented increases in seaweed production, while offshore seaweed
		cultivation is still in its infancy. The study shows large uncertainties that
		warrant further research. Modelling shows vast areas of world oceans are
		unsuitable because of being too far out of shore, having too low nutrient
		concentrations or having too high waves. Only 2–9% of world oceans and 6–25%
		of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) was shown to be suitable for seaweed
		production. Identifying suitable sites for offshore seaweed cultivation is
		therefore important. Site suitability maps reported for the 3 model species
		can be useful for private companies and policy makers expanding seaweed in
		new high potential production areas around the world.

		Understanding the vertical migration behaviour of Antarctic krill is
		important for understanding spatial distribution, ecophysiology, trophic
		interactions and carbon fluxes of this Southern Ocean key species. In this
		study, we analysed an eight-month continuous dataset recorded with an ES80
		echosounder on board a commercial krill fishing vessel in the southwest
		Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Our analysis supports the existing
		hypothesis that krill swarms migrate into deeper waters during winter but
		also reveals a high degree of variability in vertical migration behaviour
		within seasons, even at small spatial scales. During summer, we found that
		behaviour associated with prolonged surface presence primarily occurred at
		low surface chlorophyll a concentrations whereas multiple ascent–descent
		cycles per day occurred when surface chlorophyll a concentrations were
		elevated. The high plasticity, with some krill swarms behaving differently in
		the same location at the same time, suggests that krill behaviour is not a
		purely environmentally driven process. Differences in life stage, physiology
		and type of predator are likely other important drivers. Finally, our study
		demonstrates new ways of using data from krill fishing vessels, and with the
		routine collection of additional information in potential future projects,
		they have great potential to significantly advance our understanding of krill
		ecology.

		Abstract Europe faces regular introductions and reintroductions of bluetongue
		virus (BTV) serotypes, most recently exemplified by the incursion of serotype
		3 in the Netherlands. Although the long-distance wind dispersal of the
		disease vector, Culicoides spp., is recognized as a virus introduction
		pathway, it remains understudied in risk assessments. A Quantitative Risk
		Assessment framework was developed to estimate the risk of BTV-3 incursion
		into mainland Europe from Sardinia, where the virus has been present since
		2018. We used an atmospheric transport model (HYbrid Single-Particle
		Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) to infer the probability of airborne
		dispersion of the insect vector. Epidemiological disease parameters
		quantified the virus prevalence in vector population in Sardinia and its
		potential first transmission after introduction in a new area. When assuming
		a 24h maximal flight duration, the risk of BTV introduction from Sardinia is
		limited to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly affecting the southwestern area of
		the Italian Peninsula, Sicily, Malta, and Corsica. The risk extends to the
		northern and central parts of Italy, Balearic archipelago, and mainland
		France and Spain, mostly when maximal flight duration is longer than 24h.
		Additional knowledge on vector flight conditions and Obsoletus
		complex-specific parameters could improve the robustness of the model.
		Providing both spatial and temporal insights into BTV introduction risks, our
		framework is a key tool to guide global surveillance and preparedness against
		epizootics.

		Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant greenhouse gas and the most
		important currently emitted ozone depleting substance, primarily via
		agricultural fertilization. Current N2O emission estimation methods at the
		national scale are predominantly via emission factors. Models estimating
		national-scale emissions are focused on growing season emissions. However, a
		substantial fraction of N2O can be emitted during non-growing season periods.
		Using newly published off-season N2O emission ratio maps and high-resolution
		nitrogen application data, this study explores the potential magnitude of
		underestimated N2O emissions if using only the default growing-season focused
		methodology. Although there is large variation at county scales (12\%–35\%),
		non-growing season national emissions are estimated at 31\% of the total, a
		potential 12,000 Gg CO2e year−1. Further work should better refine emission
		estimates spatially as well as fully integrate estimates across growing and
		non-growing seasons.
